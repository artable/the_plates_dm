# What's Next?
## Range Input
### Requirements
- Work on a static page, so No node or react, although you may be able to transpile some frameworks to static pages.
- output via supplied callback functions
- support arbitrary placement of tick marks with text labels
- a tooltip which pops up with contextualizing information on arbitrary conditions. For example, at and around a certain value,  the tooltip will appear with some text
- styling consistent with chart.js, especially for the tooltip
- responsive, slider should not be fixed to one size and the labels and tooltip text should be resizable 



### Oooooh Beeg Stretch (goals)
- hella responsive, allowing for a vertical range slider.
